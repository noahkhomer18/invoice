# Invoice Maker

A free, open-source invoice maker for creating professional invoices without subscription fees.

## About

I've been using an app called Clockify for my invoices, however I pay for that so I understand that not everyone wants to have paid apps for their solution. That is why this open source invoice maker lets you make invoices for free. At the end simply save as PDF rather than print. I will try to keep adding more functionality but lately been busy with work a lot too.
